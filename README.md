# CatsVersusDogs
TicTacToe with Cats as X's and Dogs as O's
Decided to go with a role play element.
Got in over my head and it took much longer than I anticipated.
Originally was going to store player info as objects and then could store multiple players over time.
Proved beyond my capabilities at this point and was taking too much time so I change to using local storage and
just being able to record two players at a time.
The project was very fun. Unfortunately my sound and image files were too large for bit balloon.
So I guess people can download from my git hub.
Please enjoy and leave any suggestions.
